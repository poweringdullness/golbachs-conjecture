# Goldbach's Conjecture Checker

This project checks if Goldbach's Conjecture holds true for any given even number greater than 2.

## What is Goldbach's Conjecture?
Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

## how 2 run this code
  (really funny) <br>

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if you didn't already have Python installed.
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Open the terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where the script is.
4. Run the script with: 
```py
# just run the thing at bottom
python goldbach.py
```

5. Enter an even number, and the program will output two primes that add up to the number (if they exist).

## How the Code Works

- The code defines a function that checks if a number is prime.
- It then checks for every even number greater than 2 and tries to find two prime numbers that sum to it.
